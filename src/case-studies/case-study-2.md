intro: I was tasked with increasing quality enquiries through the website. I was
  brought on board as the UX Specialist to implement Conversion Rate
  Optimisation (CRO) and help them meet and exceed the client’s expectations.

challenge: I work with both leading agencies and scale-up companies that want to
  create user-centric products. Driven by insights, research studies and the
  latest design methodologies.
problem: Basic Google Analytics showed the performance team that the blog
  content was driving a lot of organic traffic toward the site but the
  conversion rate was around 0.5%. The average conversion rate for the legal
  sector is around 2.35%, and a high rate is around 5.31%. This was enough to
  tell me that there was room for improvement.

  My first priority was identifying what was missing by carrying out user
  interviews. This step is vital in understanding the user journey before work
  begins. 


  Three users were recruited for an in-depth, half-day user testing session. These users were chosen based on a persona model created by myself and Strategist Tom Harris from the most common user enquiries, which allowed me to match Askew’s own customers as closely as possible.

  From the interviews, I captured the relevant feedback and filtered it into
  common themes to build a base from which to work.I then took these pain points
  and common themes, and began to think creatively about how I could tackle
  them.


  These ideas are then prioritised in an effort vs impact matrix, which is necessary to identify where time is best spent to ensure the biggest ROI, ranging from low-effort easy wins to long-term projects, as well as ‘money pit’ ideas which should be avoided.

results: The site has seen a 75% increase in online enquiries since the site
  relaunched with the new UX features and user journeys in place.
