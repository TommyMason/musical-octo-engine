intro: >-
  Jobs.co.uk are one of the leading recruitment agencies in the UK. They work
  closely with Pertemps Recruitment - with who I have provided design service
  many times across many of their brands. So that’s how this project landed in
  my inbox.


  Jobs.co.uk had a concept called the ‘career assistant’ in their backlog, but for a while, it's just been collecting dust.

challenge: So we had an idea for a product, great. But so does every other Tom,
  Dick and Harry. We needed a research-driven and user-tested product concept
  that showed promise of an ROI for the business.
problem: >-
  The first thing I needed to do was get this project off to the best start
  possible. We needed to get all the team's goals and challenges on the table to
  decide where to focus first. 


  I do this by carrying out a discovery workshop where we complete a series of interactive exercises that help us define the product's goals and the challenges standing in our way.


  To help us identify the areas of opportunity of the current platform and where we needed to bridge the void, I also carried out a basic usability test of the existing website. Was this in the original scope? No. But did it provide us with a load of golden nuggets of user findings? Yes. So I didn’t mind too much as it made the end product much better.

solution: Once we had our goals and research findings in place, we had
  everything required to create a rapid prototype of our solution and get back
  in front of users to see if we’d achieved the product goals.

results: The solution ended up supporting young students to find both careers
  and further educational university courses that match their interests and key
  strengths.
