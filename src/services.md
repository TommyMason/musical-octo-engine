Over the years I have worked on thousands of digital projects to understand what works, and what doesnâ€™t. Because of this I can now offer a variety of service packages that can plug into both agile and waterfall workflows seamlessly.

My services packages all contain exercises and workflows that are backed by research studies, industry benchmarks and past project results. This ensures that projects hit the mark, everytime.
